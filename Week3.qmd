## Summary of Lecture 3

Raw remote sensing images are known to have notable distortions and flaws, which is mainly caused by the curved Earth, incompletely transparent atmosphere, varying solar radiation throughout the day and limitations of instruments. Therefore, most of the raw data captured by remote sensors are preprocessed to remove most of the flaws, it is called **Image Correction.**

Below shows a summary of 4 different correction methods, including **Geometric correction, Atmospheric correction, Orthorectification correction** and **Radiometric correction.**

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('/Users/sophiac/Desktop/Remotely sensing/Week2_quarto/Week2_Quarto/figures/correction summary.jpg')
```

In some cases, some areas we want to observe or the Region of interest (ROI) cannot be completely acquired from a single image, therefore, we would use **mosaicking**, a procedure to create a new large area image from multiple overlapping images on the same areas. The typical image mosaicking procedure includes 3 steps, including 1) tonal adjustment 2) seamline detection, and 3) image blending. In R, the function of "mosaic()" does the whole process in 1 line to form a new object with a larger spatial extent. We can specify which function to use such as mean, minimum and maximum value for output.

In this practical, I have chosen 4 tiles that make up Hong Kong, including 1 landsat8 tile and 3 landsat 9 tiles. However, as the tiles are with 2 different coordinate reference system of EPSG:32650 for two of them and EPSG:32649 for the remaining two tiles. I have tried using different methods to reproject rasters into the same projection (EPSG: 32649), however, the resolutions for the images are different from each other with 30.03617, 30.03617 (x, y) and 30.05118, 30.05118 (x, y) I couldn't figure how to alter resolution to create a mosaic image with 4 raster images, hence, I only used two of them. It works fine considering Hong kong has a really small area and can fit well in two of the images.

## Application

Some of the basic image enhancements were done in this practical. As numerous remote sensing applications such as mapping, classification, soil moisture detection require high resolution and high quality images, therefore , image enhancement is required to improve the contrast and edge information of the input image are applied to the raw input images
