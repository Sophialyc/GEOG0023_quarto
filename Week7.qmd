Due to the synoptic view nature in remote sensing images, the remote sensing images produces are in map-like format, making it a viable source of gathering effective land cover information. However, just the raw image and identification with the naked eye is not reliable and accurate. Therefore, basic image classification is important to categorize all pixels in a digital image into one of several classes. Image classification is regarded as one of the most essential part in digital image analysis as it allows allocation of semantic labels to capture image. It is useful for research, and policy making purposes as it provides better understanding and details to the content within the image. The image above is a type of image processing using a technique of **Feature Relations Map Learning** for hyperspectral image, it automatically enhance the separability of different objects in an image [@dou2020]. While using a segmented feature relations map (SFRM), it reflects the relations between spectral features through a normalized difference index (NDI), and it can then learn new features from SFRM using a CNN-based feature extractor [@dou2020]. Conventionally, there are three types of image classification, including

1.  ***Manual Classification***

2.  ***Pixel-based classification***

    1.  Supervised image classification

    2.  Unsupervised image classification

3.  ***Feature or object-based image classification***

In pixel-based classification, there are two types of image classifications,including **Unsupervised** and **Supervised** classification, where unsupervised classification is calculated by the software supervised is mainly a human-guided classification. The supervised image classification creates outcomes that are based on the software analysis without giving it sample classes. On the other hand, unsupervised classification creates outcome that is aided by providing sample pixels in an image that are representative of specific classes and then direct the image processing software to use these training sites as references for the classification of all other pixels in the image.

Referencing to [@bekan2022]'s GIS blog about the pros and cons of supervised and unsupervised image classification, both classification techniques has its disadvantages
