Therefore, most of the raw data captured by remote sensors are preprocessed to remove most of the flaws, it is called **Image Correction.**\n\nBelow shows a summary of 4 different correction methods, including **Geometric correction, Atmospheric correction, Orthorectification correction** and **Radiometric correction.**\n\n```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = \"100%\", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE}\nknitr::include_graphics('/Users/sophiac/Desktop/Remotely sensing/Week2_quarto/Week2_Quarto/figures/correction summary.jpg')\n```\n\nIn some cases, some areas we want to observe or the Region of interest (ROI) cannot be completely acquired from a single image, therefore, we would use **mosaicking**, a procedure to create a new large area image from multiple overlapping images on the same areas. The typical image mosaicking procedure includes 3 steps, including 1) tonal adjustment 2) seamline detection, and 3) image blending. In R, the function of \"mosaic()\" does the whole process in 1 line to form a new object with a larger spatial extent. We can specify which function to use such as mean, minimum and maximum value for output.\n\nIn this practical, I have chosen 4 tiles that make up Hong Kong, including 1 landsat8 tile and 3 landsat 9 tiles. However, as the tiles are with 2 different coordinate reference system of EPSG:32650 for two of them and EPSG:32649 for the remaining two tiles. I have tried using different methods to reproject rasters into the same projection (EPSG: 32649), however, the resolutions for the images are different from each other with 30.03617, 30.03617 (x, y) and 30.05118, 30.05118 (x, y) I couldn't figure how to alter resolution to create a mosaic image with 4 raster images, hence, I only used two of them. It works fine considering Hong kong has a really small area and can fit well in two of the images.\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width=\"49%\", out.height=\"20%\",fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}\nknitr::include_graphics(c(\"figures/week3_1.png\",\"figures/week3_2.png\"))\n\n```\n\n\\\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width=\"49%\", out.height=\"20%\",fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}\nknitr::include_graphics('figures/week3_3.png')\n\n```\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\n## Application\n\n## Reflection\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":false,"output-file":"Week3.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","bibliography":["references.bib"],"theme":{"light":["Lux","flatly"],"dark":["Lux","darkly","dark.css"]},"title-block-banner":"figures/hk.jpeg","title-block-style":"default","title-block-categories":false,"title-block-banner-color":"body","title":"Week 3"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
