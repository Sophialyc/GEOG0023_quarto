I was born and raised in Hong Kong, I have recently finished my Bachelor’s degree at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2022, majoring in Geography and Resource Management. I would love to share a picture of one of my favourite places in Hong Kong, which is the Victoria Harbour, it separates the Hong Kong Island in the south from the Kowloon Peninsula to the north.\n\n\n\n\n\nHong Kong’s skyline. Source:https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/Destinations/Asia/Hong%20Kong/hong-kong-victoria-peak-pano-guide.jpg\n\n\n\n\nWith interest in geospatial science, I have decided to pursue a Master’s degree related to it, hence, I am now studying the MSc Social and Geographic Data Science at UCL. I am very new to programming, and it is always a challenge for me to troubleshoot errors and problems in Rstudio and python when performing different types of spatial analysis, and data manipulation. I hope to improve and enhance my skills on geospatial science in this degree. Besides, I want to learn more about remote sensing, because I have not been taking many courses related to remote sensing in the past. So, I hope I can learn about the principles and important concepts in remote sensing, and utilize the knowledge in the future. For each week, there will be summary and application example, followed by a reflection, please enjoy."

    "text": "1.1 Summary of Lecture 1\nRemote sensing in short is the detection and monitoring of the earth or a certain area through measurements of the reflected and emitted radiation at a distance. There are various types of remote sensing instruments, and there are 2 types of them, including active sensor and passive sensor.\n\nActive Sensors: Contain own energy source for illumination. They illuminate target objects and actively send pulses and measure the backscatters reflected to them. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and laser fluorosensor are examples of active sensors.\nPassive Sensors: Do not have any illuminating source. They detect and reflect energy when it is naturally available, and only take place during the time when the sun is illuminating the Earth. Passive infrared sensor (PIR) and radiometers are examples of passive sensors.\n\nThe aforementioned term of “energy” is concisely referring to the energy emitted from the sun, which comes as Electromagnetic radiation (EMR) or Electromagnetic waves (EM waves) to the earth. They are waves of magnetic and electric fields spreading across different wavelength from very short gamma rays, x-ray to infrared waves, and micro waves etc. EM waves travel through vacuum of space at constant speed of light.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Electromagnetic Spectrum. Source:https://mynasadata.larc.nasa.gov/basic-page/electromagnetic-spectrum-diagram\n\n\n\n\nBefore EMR is received by sensors, several processes and changes are required before hitting the sensors, including energy absorption by the surface, transmission through surface and scattering by particles in the atmosphere.\nIn practical 1, sentinel products were used. It is a product that has been processed through multi-spectral imagery. The spectral imagery is one of the four resolutions used in all remotely sensed data, it contains layer of different bands. I have chosen the Zeeland province of the Netherlands, it is located in the southwestern part consisting islands and peninsulas which are interconnected by the dams and bridges of the Delta Works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis figure shown above is a True Color Image (TCI) that contains B02, B03 and B04 for blue, green and red bands. Yet, the image remain a single raster layer that has a limited value from 0 - 255. In order to enhance the resolution for the sentinel product that has higher much higher brightness level, a raster band could be made manually with the existing separate bands from the Sentinel-2 Level-2A product.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in the figure, I have recreated the true color composite using the RGB window, selecting band B04 , B03 and B02 for red, green and blue respectively. The image colour is slightly different from the TCI because I have used the ‘Colour Manipulation’ function to change the distribution of the three bands. The scatter plot on the left shows B04 against B08, which implies the vegetation cover of the area. As the y-axis is the near-infrared reflectance, and x-axis is the red band, high values of y and low values of x in the plot represents dense canopy while low values of both x and y are most likely wet bare soil. From the graph, the image contains little vegetation cover and more soil that is wet and bare."

    "section": "1.2 Application",
    "text": "1.2 Application\nWhile remote sensors detect, quantify and record the EM energy, the captured satellite images are geo-referenced. One of the most common applications is land cover remote sensing analysis. According to Aplin (2004), different land cover features reflect EM radiation differently, hence, the distinctive radiation provides the representations of land cover variation. As passive sensors require external illumination source, they are dependent to the sun as a source of light and are limited by various conditions. Tempfli et al. (2009) stated that at conditions like during nighttime, when solar radiation is absent and in areas that are mostly covered under clouds, remote sensors are useless. On the contrary, active sensors that have their own source of illumination can operate at any time because they are can emit EM energy and detect the energy returning from the target object or surface.\nSentinel-2A Level 2A products provide Bottom Of Atmosphere (BOA) reflectance images derived from the associated Level-1C products that provide Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. The Sentinel 2 product has 13 bands of data in 10, 20 and 60 meters pixel size respectively and carries the Multispectral Imager (MSI). B04, B03 and B02 represent Red, Green and Blue respectively, the combination of these 3 bands creates a natural colour imagery that resembles the same way our eyes visualize the real world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this image, urban features tend to appear in white and grey, while water is dark blue and vegetation is green. This image is very similar to the TCI provided in the data downloaded\nAs vegetation strongly reflects near-infrared radiation and absorbs red light, rather than generating aa vegetation index ((B8-B4)/(B8+B4)), a scatter plot of B8 against B4 can also reflect vegetation of the image. From the figure below, the “Tasseled Cap” shape is created. It reveals that vegetation does not contribute big proportion in the image as the zone of low red and high near infrared values are narrow. Instead, many values concentrate at the low red and low infrared regions, showing that water is present and has higher ratio in the image. Referring back to the image, it is true that the image contains both land and sea. In addition, the values of higher red band values indicate that vegetation decreases as their presence can absorb red bands. Large part of the image that are not ocean is developed and built area."

    "text": "1.3 Reflection\nI personally think that remote sensing is way more useful and complicated than it sounds. As I have always focused on learning how to manipulate and wrangle vector data in GIS, I seldom use satellite images as I thought it would only be an image that shows the land features succinctly. However, this practical has definitely made me realized that satellite images could do more than that. I am especially interested with the multispectral bands in the sentinel 2 product. The different combinations of bands could create and reveal different information from an image. Other than the natural colour of B4, B3 and B2, there are many different combination. With knowledge on what land features absorb and reflect, the combinations could create images that allow classifcation of land features in a more detailed manner. For example, colour infrared image of B8, B4 and B3 can reveal healthy and unhealthy vegetation as near-infrared band is good at reflecting chlorpophyll. A Bathymetric image of B4, B3 and B1 is favourable for coastal studies as the coastal aerosol band can estimate suspended sediment in water more accurately. Also, a moisture index image composed of (B8A-B11)/(B8A+B11) can reveal moisture content and perhaps water stress in plants. There are still a lot of combinations of bands, I think it is especially useful for people to gain a brief understanding to a specific area before actually go on a site visit.\n\n\n\n\nAplin, Paul. 2004. “Remote Sensing: Land Cover.” Progress in Physical Geography: Earth and Environment 28 (2): 283–93. https://doi.org/10.1191/0309133304pp413pr.\n\n\nTempfli, Klaus, G.

    "section": "3.1 Summary of Lecture 3",
    "text": "3.1 Summary of Lecture 3\nRaw remote sensing images are known to have notable distortions and flaws, which is mainly caused by the curved Earth, incompletely transparent atmosphere, varying solar radiation throughout the day and limitations of instruments. Therefore, most of the raw data captured by remote sensors are preprocessed to remove most of the flaws, it is called Image Correction.\nBelow shows a summary of 4 different correction methods, including Geometric correction, Atmospheric correction, Orthorectification correction and Radiometric correction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some cases, some areas we want to observe or the Region of interest (ROI) cannot be completely acquired from a single image, therefore, we would use mosaicking, a procedure to create a new large area image from multiple overlapping images on the same areas. The typical image mosaicking procedure includes 3 steps, including 1) tonal adjustment 2) seamline detection, and 3) image blending. In R, the function of “mosaic()” does the whole process in 1 line to form a new object with a larger spatial extent. We can specify which function to use such as mean, minimum and maximum value for output.\nIn this practical, I have chosen 4 tiles that make up Hong Kong, including 1 landsat8 tile and 3 landsat 9 tiles. However, as the tiles are with 2 different coordinate reference system of EPSG:32650 for two of them and EPSG:32649 for the remaining two tiles. I have tried using different methods to reproject rasters into the same projection (EPSG: 32649), however, the resolutions for the images are different from each other with 30.03617, 30.03617 (x, y) and 30.05118, 30.05118 (x, y) I couldn’t figure how to alter resolution to create a mosaic image with 4 raster images, hence, I only used two of them. It works fine considering Hong kong has a really small area and can fit well in two of the images."

While global warming is not a globally uniform warming phenomenon, some regions are affected at greater level. The figure above shows the temperature difference in 2020 compared to the average temperature in 1981-2020. The large variations in temperature difference in different regions indicated that climate change has unequal effects on temperature globally. Global Climate Risk Index (https://reliefweb.int/report/world/global-climate-risk-index-2021) is an index generated by Germanwatch, it analyses quantified impacts of extreme weather events and ranks countries according to the level of exposure and vulnerability to extreme events. The long-term Global Climate Risk Index (CRI) published in 2021 examines global data from 2000-2019, Spain ranked 29 out of 180 countries. with CRI score of 46.50. This risk score indicates a relatively lower risk to other countries because lower risk scores have higher risk to climate impacts, such as Puerto Rico ranked 1st with risk score of 7.17.\nSpain is getting warmer and drier than previous decades, the Meditarranean region in Spain has increased by 1.5 degree Celsius, which is more than global average increase of 1.1 degree Celsius.

The programme aims to improve air quality, decrease desertification and flood risks, support biodiversity, and act as a thermal regulator for the city as it will mitigate Madrid's urban heat island. It is a long-term city project that will take about 12 years to complete. When this forest reaches maturity, it will absorb 170,000 tons of CO2. The proposed plan is to create environmental belt around Madrid's perimeters with new parks, children's zones, dog trails and hiking and biking routes for city-dwellers and tourists.\nThe Strategic Planning of the Madrid Metropolitan Forest is shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\nStrategic Planning of the Madrid Metropolitan Forest.

The authority considered the southern part as a great opportunity to make interconnected green infrastructure. The first phase will take place in areas that allow immediate interventions including Vicálvaro and Villa de Vallecas.\nWhile this is a long-term policy that is expected to finish in 12 years, various uncertainties and challenges are faced on implementing different phases of greening in the city.
