I am very new to programming, and it is always a challenge for me to troubleshoot errors and problems in Rstudio and python when performing different types of spatial analysis, and data manipulation. I hope to improve and enhance my skills on geospatial science in this degree. Besides, I want to learn more about remote sensing, because I have not been taking many courses related to remote sensing in the past. So, I hope I can learn about the principles and important concepts in remote sensing, and utilize the knowledge in the future. For each week, there will be summary and application example, followed by a reflection, please enjoy."

    "text": "1.1 Summary of Lecture 1\nRemote sensing in short is the detection and monitoring of the earth or a certain area through measurements of the reflected and emitted radiation at a distance. There are various types of remote sensing instruments, and there are 2 types of them, including active sensor and passive sensor.\n\nActive Sensors: Contain own energy source for illumination. They illuminate target objects and actively send pulses and measure the backscatters reflected to them. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and laser fluorosensor are examples of active sensors.\nPassive Sensors: Do not have any illuminating source. They detect and reflect energy when it is naturally available, and only take place during the time when the sun is illuminating the Earth. Passive infrared sensor (PIR) and radiometers are examples of passive sensors.\n\nThe aforementioned term of “energy” is concisely referring to the energy emitted from the sun, which comes as Electromagnetic radiation (EMR) or Electromagnetic waves (EM waves) to the earth. They are waves of magnetic and electric fields spreading across different wavelength from very short gamma rays, x-ray to infrared waves, and micro waves etc. EM waves travel through vacuum of space at constant speed of light.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Electromagnetic Spectrum. Source:https://mynasadata.larc.nasa.gov/basic-page/electromagnetic-spectrum-diagram\n\n\n\n\nBefore EMR is received by sensors, several processes and changes are required before hitting the sensors, including energy absorption by the surface, transmission through surface and scattering by particles in the atmosphere.\nIn practical 1, sentinel products were used. It is a product that has been processed through multi-spectral imagery. The spectral imagery is one of the four resolutions used in all remotely sensed data, it contains layer of different bands. I have chosen the Zeeland province of the Netherlands, it is located in the southwestern part consisting islands and peninsulas which are interconnected by the dams and bridges of the Delta Works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis figure shown above is a True Color Image (TCI) that contains B02, B03 and B04 for blue, green and red bands. Yet, the image remain a single raster layer that has a limited value from 0 - 255. In order to enhance the resolution for the sentinel product that has higher much higher brightness level, a raster band could be made manually with the existing separate bands from the Sentinel-2 Level-2A product.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in the figure, I have recreated the true color composite using the RGB window, selecting band B04 , B03 and B02 for red, green and blue respectively. The image colour is slightly different from the TCI because I have used the ‘Colour Manipulation’ function to change the distribution of the three bands. The scatter plot on the left shows B04 against B08, which implies the vegetation cover of the area. As the y-axis is the near-infrared reflectance, and x-axis is the red band, high values of y and low values of x in the plot represents dense canopy while low values of both x and y are most likely wet bare soil. From the graph, the image contains little vegetation cover and more soil that is wet and bare."

    "section": "1.2 Application",
    "text": "1.2 Application\nWhile remote sensors detect, quantify and record the EM energy, the captured satellite images are geo-referenced. One of the most common applications is land cover remote sensing analysis. According to Aplin (2004), different land cover features reflect EM radiation differently, hence, the distinctive radiation provides the representations of land cover variation. As passive sensors require external illumination source, they are dependent to the sun as a source of light and are limited by various conditions. Tempfli et al. (2009) stated that at conditions like during nighttime, when solar radiation is absent and in areas that are mostly covered under clouds, remote sensors are useless. On the contrary, active sensors that have their own source of illumination can operate at any time because they are can emit EM energy and detect the energy returning from the target object or surface.\nSentinel-2A Level 2A products provide Bottom Of Atmosphere (BOA) reflectance images derived from the associated Level-1C products that provide Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. The Sentinel 2 product has 13 bands of data in 10, 20 and 60 meters pixel size respectively and carries the Multispectral Imager (MSI). B04, B03 and B02 represent Red, Green and Blue respectively, the combination of these 3 bands creates a natural colour imagery that resembles the same way our eyes visualize the real world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this image, urban features tend to appear in white and grey, while water is dark blue and vegetation is green. This image is very similar to the TCI provided in the data downloaded\nAs vegetation strongly reflects near-infrared radiation and absorbs red light, rather than generating aa vegetation index ((B8-B4)/(B8+B4)), a scatter plot of B8 against B4 can also reflect vegetation of the image. From the figure below, the “Tasseled Cap” shape is created. It reveals that vegetation does not contribute big proportion in the image as the zone of low red and high near infrared values are narrow. Instead, many values concentrate at the low red and low infrared regions, showing that water is present and has higher ratio in the image. Referring back to the image, it is true that the image contains both land and sea. In addition, the values of higher red band values indicate that vegetation decreases as their presence can absorb red bands. Large part of the image that are not ocean is developed and built area."

    "text": "1.3 Reflection\nI personally think that remote sensing is way more useful and complicated than it sounds. As I have always focused on learning how to manipulate and wrangle vector data in GIS, I seldom use satellite images as I thought it would only be an image that shows the land features succinctly. However, this practical has definitely made me realized that satellite images could do more than that. I am especially interested with the multispectral bands in the sentinel 2 product. The different combinations of bands could create and reveal different information from an image. Other than the natural colour of B4, B3 and B2, there are many different combination. With knowledge on what land features absorb and reflect, the combinations could create images that allow classifcation of land features in a more detailed manner. For example, colour infrared image of B8, B4 and B3 can reveal healthy and unhealthy vegetation as near-infrared band is good at reflecting chlorpophyll. A Bathymetric image of B4, B3 and B1 is favourable for coastal studies as the coastal aerosol band can estimate suspended sediment in water more accurately. Also, a moisture index image composed of (B8A-B11)/(B8A+B11) can reveal moisture content and perhaps water stress in plants. There are still a lot of combinations of bands, I think it is especially useful for people to gain a brief understanding to a specific area before actually go on a site visit.\n\n\n\n\nAplin, Paul. 2004. “Remote Sensing: Land Cover.” Progress in Physical Geography: Earth and Environment 28 (2): 283–93. https://doi.org/10.1191/0309133304pp413pr.\n\n\nTempfli, Klaus, G.

    "text": "3.1 Summary of Lecture 3\nRaw remote sensing images are known to have notable distortions and flaws, which is mainly caused by the curved Earth, incompletely transparent atmosphere, varying solar radiation throughout the day and limitations of instruments. Therefore, most of the raw data captured by remote sensors are preprocessed to remove most of the flaws, it is called Image Correction.\nBelow shows a summary of 4 different correction methods, including Geometric correction, Atmospheric correction, Orthorectification correction and Radiometric correction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some cases, some areas we want to observe or the Region of interest (ROI) cannot be completely acquired from a single image, therefore, we would use mosaicking, a procedure to create a new large area image from multiple overlapping images on the same areas. The typical image mosaicking procedure includes 3 steps, including 1) tonal adjustment 2) seamline detection, and 3) image blending. In R, the function of “mosaic()” does the whole process in 1 line to form a new object with a larger spatial extent. We can specify which function to use such as mean, minimum and maximum value for output.\nIn this practical, I have chosen 4 tiles that consist parts of Hong Kong, including 1 Landsat 8 tile and 3 Landsat 9 tiles. However, as the tiles are with 2 different coordinate reference system of EPSG:32650 for two of them and EPSG:32649 for the remaining two tiles. I have tried using different methods to reproject rasters into the same projection (EPSG: 32649), however, the resolutions for the images are different from each other with 30.03617, 30.03617 (x, y) and 30.05118, 30.05118 (x, y). Hence, with limimte time and I couldn’t figure how to alter resolution to create a mosaic image with 4 raster images. I decided to only used two of tiles to create mosaic image of the Pearl River Delta whicn includes also Hong Kong. It works fine considering Hong kong is a really small area and can fit well with two of the images.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow shows a summary of the initial obtained image of the mosaic image, which are bands of Landsat 9. Landsat 9 is similar to Landsat 8, but is designed to image four visible spectral bands, one near-infrared spectral band, three shortwave-infrared spectral bands at 30 m (98 ft) spatial resolution, and one panchromatic band at 15 m (49 ft) spatial resolution, and two thermal bands at 100 m (328 ft) spatial resolution. In this practical, band 8 of the spectral bands are not used. Band 1 is used specially to measure chlorophyll concentrations, band 9 is used to detect cirrus clouds by measuring light in the part of the electromagnetic spectrum where the clouds are most visible.\n\n\n\n\n\nBands of created image"

    "text": "3.2 Application\n\nSome of the basic image enhancements were done in this practical. As numerous remote sensing applications such as mapping, classification, soil moisture detection require high resolution and high quality images, therefore , the raw remote sensing images can be enhanced by improving the contrast and edge information of the input image. I have followed the steps in the practical to create the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for the images around Hong Kong. It is calculated from the visible and near-infrared light reflected by vegetation where healthy and green vegetation reflects more in the NIR and absorbs in the Red wavelength. The land surfaces shown below are mostly yellowish (0.2-0.4) in colour, except where the delta lies in the middle. The colour scheme for the red circled area (Hong Kong) displayed shows gradual change from yellow to green (>0/4). The green areas are mostly green spaces are hills in Hong Kong.\n\n\n\n\n\nthe NDVI index for Pearl River Delta.\n\n\n\n\nThe index between 0.2-0.4, which is shown in yellow colour here, refers to the presence of sparse vegetation while value above 0.4 refers to moderate to high density of vegetation. The lower figure has pulled out areas with vegetation, where NDVI values are set to equal or above 0.2. I think it is effective to generate different indexes to identify different land features, then create filters with certain value to pull out the features more precisely.\n\n\n\n\n\nthe vegetation for Pearl River Delta.\n\n\n\n\nThe table below shows some other different indices and corresponding equations for different features’ identification, such as water, geology and landscape indices. I think this makes remote sensing a very useful tool as it helps identify different land features easily.\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Image Indices \n    Equation \n  \n \n\n  \n    Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI2) \n    MSAVI2 = (1/2)*(2(NIR+1)-sqrt((2*NIR+1)2-8(NIR-Red))) \n  \n  \n    Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) \n    SAVI = ((NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red + L)) x (1 + L) \n  \n  \n    Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) \n    NDSI = (Green - SWIR) / (Green + SWIR) \n  \n  \n    Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) \n    MNDWI = (Green - SWIR) / (Green + SWIR) \n  \n  \n    Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) \n    NDMI = (NIR - SWIR1)/(NIR + SWIR1) \n  \n  \n    Clay Mineral Ratio \n    Clay Minerals Ratio = SWIR1 / SWIR2 \n  \n  \n    Ferrous Minerals Ratio \n    Ferrous Minerals Ratio = SWIR / NIR \n  \n  \n    Iron Oxide Ratio \n    Iron Oxide Ratio = Red / Blue \n  \n  \n    Burn Area Index (BAI) \n    BAI = 1/((0.1 -RED)^2 + (0.06 - NIR)^2) \n  \n  \n    Normalized Burn Ratio Index (NBRI) \n    NBR = (NIR - SWIR) / (NIR+ SWIR) \n  \n  \n    Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) \n    NDBI = (SWIR - NIR) / (SWIR + NIR) \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe next interesting thing of this practical is the texture analysis. Image texture is generally considered as the change and repeat of image grey in space, by adding texture information to the original spectral information of the image can improve the correction and precision. Image texture is the quantification of intuitive qualities described by terms such as rough, smooth, silky, or bumpy as a function of the spatial variation in pixel intensities. I used band 4 (red) and band 5(NIR) for texture analysis illustration, Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM) is adopted to describe the basic cell of texture orrandom and spatial statistic character in local pattern. To find texture features from GLCM for texture classification, the criteria of Homogeneity is adopted, which measures the closeness of the distribution of elements in the GLCM to the GLCM diagonal. Some other possible criteria such as Energy, Entropy, Contrast etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexture"

The large variations in temperature difference in different regions indicated that climate change has unequal effects on temperature globally. Global Climate Risk Index is an index generated by Germanwatch, it analyses quantified impacts of extreme weather events and ranks countries according to the level of exposure and vulnerability to extreme events. The long-term Global Climate Risk Index (CRI) published in 2021 examines global data from 2000-2019, Spain ranked 29 out of 180 countries. with CRI score of 46.50. This risk score indicates a relatively lower risk to other countries because lower risk scores have higher risk to climate impacts, such as Puerto Rico ranked 1st with risk score of 7.17.\nSpain is getting warmer and drier than previous decades, the Meditarranean region in Spain has increased by 1.5 degree Celsius, which is more than global average increase of 1.1 degree Celsius.

A meteorologist for the State Meteorological agency (AEMET) stated that large parts of the peninsula will enter one of the hottest regions on the surface of the planet. It will be an extension of the traditional summer ‘heat belt’ that usually extends from Algeria to India Benayas (2021). For Madrid, it has increased 2°C in the past 30 years, the maximum summer temperatures are on average higher than 38°C and the city is suffering from longer and more frequents heatwaves.

Winning proposal from competitions hosted for Metropolitan Foest is used as a feasible way in developing the Metropolitan forest. The aim of this programme is to combat climate change by building a 75km-long metropolitan forest in the city. The forest construction will contribute to the rebalancing of the city, reducing of CO2 emissions, improving air quality, decreasing desertification and flood risks, support biodiversity, and act as a thermal regulator for the city as it will mitigate Madrid’s urban heat island. It is a long-term city project that will take about 12 years to complete. When this forest reaches maturity, it will potentially be able to absorb 170,000 tons of CO2. The proposed plan would not only alleviate the impacts brought by climate change, but will also benefit in nature and social aspects. It will facilitate ecological and landscape restoration of degraded areas and increasing pedestrian and cycling routes, as well as benefiting the health of the population.\nThe proposed plan is to create environmental belt around Madrid’s perimeters with new parks, children’s zones, dog trails and hiking and biking routes for city-dwellers and tourists. It will be a forest belt encircling the city. The Strategic Planning of the Madrid Metropolitan Forest is shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\nStrategic Planning of the Madrid Metropolitan Forest.

The authority considered the southern part as a great opportunity to make interconnected green infrastructure. The first phase will take place in areas that allow immediate interventions including Vicálvaro and Villa de Vallecas.\nWhile this is a long-term policy that is expected to finish in 12 years, various uncertainties and challenges are faced on implementing different phases of greening in the city. Hence, remote sensing techniques can be used to identify and provide suggestions in combating these challenges."

Remote sensing is an ideal tool for conducting various analysis and monitoring a large scale urban forestry project. In this context, there are 5 different regions that could adopt remote sensing differently in aid to the project’s objectives.\n\n4.2.0.1 Area 1: Among Natural Forest\nFirst, for area 1, that is to connect a peri-urban space of 1,400 ha to the high valuable forests of El Prado, Valdelatas mountains and Casa de Campo. The area acts as a transitional space between the nature to existing urban parks, making environmental protection compatible with walks and healthy leisure activities. Hence, remote sensing for biodiversity in the forests in the north, distinguishing species, or identify species of individual trees (Turner et al. 2003). The information of the diversity pattern , especially on the fringe could be used to determine types of trees, and the density of trees to be planted so as to conserve species and lower impacts on local ecosystem, simultaneously, helping the design of infrastructures such as walks, experimental farms and leisure activities in the transitional space. For example, Polyakova et al. (2023) has used Sentinel-2 Satellite Data in automated recognition of tree species in Raifa forest, Russia. The reflectances of tree species are observed in the red-edge (Band 6, Band 7) and near-infrared (Band 8, Band 8a) bands in all images. The image below shows the classification of tree specices using sentinel-2 level2A images.\n\n\n\n\n\nSentinel-2 data classification results: (a) RF method; (b) GTM method. Source: https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/15/2/329\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.0.2 Area 2: Uniting Urban Parks\nWhile for area 2, large parks in Madrid are often disconnected with the presence of infrastructures. Hence, the main objective is to connect green spaces of the general system of free spaces with a forest avenue that will have a bike path and a large walking area that will unite all the large parks of our city. As urban green spaces should be constructed in a hierachical structure, where vegetations in different areas contains different social functions, such as public parks, residential green space, green buffer. Remote sensing images can identify different social functions of different vegetation patches with spectral analysis to vegetation and non-vegetation areas. Hence, the extent of disconnected green spaces in aid with functions of existing green spaces can be used to determine the density of trees and types of greening to implement, such as ecoducts that allow cyclist and pedestrians movement. This way, the urban structures and urban functions of the original areas could be retained while greening is built on.\n\n\n\n\n\nVegetation types (a–c) and vegetation patches with various social functions (d–h) in satellite images.

The main objective is to value the free spaces of the new growths of the southeast. Arid soil in the area can be captured with remote sensors for soil analysis, the variations in soil properties within the large areas can imply the specific type of vegetation and soil conservation measures in order to successfully establish roots in the varying arid soils, hence connecting to the fertile valleys of Manzanares and Jarama. Soil parameters including soil moisture, roughness, temperature and texture could be retrieved through both active and passive remote sensing. For active remote sensing, sensors like Synthetic Aperture radar (SAR) are more focused on local and regional studies with high resolution images, while scatterometers are more adopted for global estimations of soil properties (Zribi, Baghdadi, and Nolin 2012). For passive remote sensing, Landsat, ASTER are more use for vegetation cover description, land use analysis, hyperspectral sensors provides soil texture description and thermal infrared band are adapted for soil temperature estimation (Zribi, Baghdadi, and Nolin 2012).\n\n\n4.2.0.4 Area 4: River Parks of the South\nThe creation of an agricultural park is planned to enhance the fertile plain of the Manzanares, which will be complemented with equipment in the area of ​​the fourth lock, called the farmer’s house. The essential resources for establishing forests can be retreived through remote sensing such as temperature variations, soil properties, water resources, solar radiation variability. Passive remote sensing could be adopted in this sense to capture the illumination hour of solar radiation on the area. Thus, with the information, trees could be planted in a cautious manner to aid sustainable forest management, such as preventing erosion or the accumulation of runoff water from the surrounding hills to increase the flow of the river. The planting of trees does not only improve the air quality and physical environment, but also regulating the water cycle indirectly.\n\n\n4.2.0.5 Area 5: The Metropolitan Ring\nThe main objective for this area is to create a green space between the neighboring municipalities supported by infrastructure borders, the Butarque stream and the large Campamento land reserve. This area’s forestation will demand more on serving the neigbouring population and neighboring municipalities supported by infrastructure borders. The purpose of trees plantation in this area is to create an ecological restoration center and a equipment dedicated to a business incubator that promotes the green economy model. Hence, remote sensing could do similar work to the other areas to create a plan that benifits the envionrment, economy and society functionings. One of the possible ways is to implement street tree planting with precise locations or developing vertical plantations that helps alleviate high urban temperature area using remotely sensed thermal infrared data for land surface temperature (LST) to detect urban heat island effects to the urban areas within the area (Keeratikasikorn and Bonafoni 2018). Then, the correspond surface urban heat island (SUHI) map can be generated to compare with the previous Land plan maps to identify places that are required to plant trees (Keeratikasikorn and Bonafoni 2018).\n\n\n\n\n\nSUHI maps of Bangkok urban area obtained by the seven Landsat 8 clear-sky images. The last map represents the mean SUHI of the seven images.

In general, data for air quality, land cover classification, heat index, soil parameters are common criteria for solving challenges for the implementation of metropolitan forests in Madrid."

    "text": "4.3 Reflection\nClimate change is an imminent problem faced by the globe, the impacts brought by is definitely not only by the rise of surface temperature, but also harming the balance of the world such as extreme natural hazards, heat waves and dangerous weathers that threaten lives on earth. I think the metropolitan forest plan brought up in Madrid is a very direct action responding to climate change as growing trees remove carbon dioxides and increased carbon sink, bringing immediate benefits to the society and climate. I think remote sensing could contribute a lot in policies like this as it provides crucial visualisation that reveal the potentials and the basis of an urban area, hence can act as a guidance for constructing a feasible plan to implement within urbanised land. However, one concern that comes to mind is the sustainability and maintenance of the urban forests. Regular and attentive monitoring on the growth of trees is a requisite element because of various possibilites. For instance, the growing conditions in urban environment can be hard, such as pollutants, limited space above and below ground that inhibit growth. Also, encroachment to development can also occur, where roots of trees could cause structural damage to buildings, and in extreme cases, harming the foundations of buildings. Hence, I think a large scale urban forest plan should have more frequent assessment and monitoring so as to prevent and maintain a stable conditions for both urban and nature.\n\n\n\n\nBenayas, Victoria Torres. 2021. “Spain Braces for ‘Extreme’ Weekend Heat with Temperatures Set to Top 44ºc.” https://english.elpais.com/spain/2021-07-09/spain-braces-for-extreme-weekend-heat-with-temperatures-set-to-top-44c.html.\n\n\nKeeratikasikorn, Chaiyapon, and Stefania Bonafoni. 2018. “Urban Heat Island Analysis over the Land Use Zoning Plan of Bangkok by Means of Landsat 8 Imagery.” Remote Sensing 10 (3): 440. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs10030440.\n\n\nLorenzo, M.
