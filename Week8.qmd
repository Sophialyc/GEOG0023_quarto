## Summary of Lecture 8

This week, we covered Urban Heat Island (UHI) and policy related to it. UHI occur when cities replace natural land cover with dense concentrations of pavement, buildings and urban structures that absorb and retain heat. In highly concentrated urrban areas with limited greenery, the area will become "islands" of higher temperatures relative to outlying areas [@usepa2014]. There are factors that cause and intensify UHI, such as heat generated from human activities, weather and geography and reduced natural landscapes in urban areas. However, from the view of remote sensing, there are two main factors that is identified as UHI from the images, including the dark surfaces that retain heat and less vegetation to regulate temperature. The magnitude of UHI in world cities are shown below,
